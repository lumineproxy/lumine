# Lumine Proxy 

**Lumine Proxy** is a Gophertunnel-based Minecraft Bedrock Edition proxy responsible for handling proxy-side logic in the **Lumine** ecosystem.  
It is part of a multi-repository project including the client, launcher, API, and Discord bot.

---

## Project Structure

The Lumine ecosystem is divided into several components:

- **client** – Wails & Next.js based web application handling Lumine Proxy’s frontend.  
- **proxy** – Gophertunnel-based proxy for Bedrock Edition logic (this repository).  
- **launcher** – Golang-based launcher that manages obfuscated Lumine builds during runtime.  
- **api** – REST API (Go) for key handling and distributing production models.  
- **discord** – Rust + Serenity based Discord bot for generating Lumine keys.  
- **gophertunnel** – General purpose Bedrock library in Go (MIT Licensed).

## Ecosystem Complexity & Security

The Lumine ecosystem is designed with layered complexity and security in mind. Each component works together in a tightly integrated flow to ensure both functionality and protection against tampering or exploitation:

Launcher – Handles runtime operations by securely pulling frontend data from the API through obfuscated and encrypted HTTP calls.

Frontend (Wails) – Once data is received, the Wails-based frontend executes and manages the interaction with the user.

Proxy Execution – The proxy is unencrypted at runtime inside a protected, obfuscated memory space. After execution, it actively removes any trace of its presence to reduce the attack surface and prevent reverse-engineering or exploitation.

This architecture not only enables advanced features (multi-account handling, keybinding, built-in commands) but also provides a hardened environment that makes it significantly more resilient against external manipulation.

## Tech Stack

- **Go** – Core proxy logic (Gophertunnel).  
- **TypeScript / Next.js / Wails** – Frontend client.  
- **Rust (Serenity)** – Discord bot.  
- **REST API** – Backend key distribution.  

---

## Proxy Features

- Custom keybinding
- Multiple account handling
- Scalable
- Built-in utility & exploit commands (toggleable)
